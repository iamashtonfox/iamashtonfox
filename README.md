# Hi, I'm Ashton!

I am a soon-to-be graduate of Boston University passionate about cybersecurity, AI, and user safety. I have experience in full-stack, frontend, and backend designing websites, servers, and applications, and the main languages that I work in are C, Java, and Python.

My personal Github page is out-of-date, as I am busy with classes, and intend to migrate all my relevant work and projects once I am finished with my classes. You can see a bit more of my work on my BU github page at https://github.com/ashtonfox20

### You can find out more about me on [my website](https://iamashtonfox.github.io/)
