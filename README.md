# Hi, I'm Ashton!

I am a fresh Boston University graduate, passionate about developing software, AI, and user safety. I have experience in full-stack, frontend, and backend designing websites, servers, and applications, and the main languages that I work in are Java, Javascript, and Python.

I am currently busy building a portfolio website before I migrate my college projects to this account, but you can see a bit more of my work on my BU github page at https://github.com/ashtonfox20

### You can find out more about me on [my website](https://iamashtonfox.github.io/)
